"""
This module helps integrating Qt stuff in Clarisse.
It must be imported AFTER having imported your Qt binding module (PySide(2), PyQt, etc.)
Here is a very basic example:

```
# import Qt bindings
from PySide2 import QtCore, QtWidgets
# import this helper
import QtHelper

# from here, you can create your UI like usual
widget = QtWidgets.QWidget()

textLabel = QtWidgets.QLabel(widget)
textLabel.setText("Hello")
textLabel.move(110, 85)

widget.setGeometry(50, 50, 320, 200)
widget.setWindowTitle("PySide2 Example")

# show the top level widget
widget.show()

# and execute. This call will only return once `widget` is closed.
QtHelper.run(widget)
```
"""

import ix
import os


def run(widgets = None):
    """
    Start the Qt "app". This will interface a Qt event loop with Clarisse's own event loop so that both can
    coexist without blocking one another. This call will be blocking or not, depending on the `widgets` parameter.

    @note
        Do not call this with a non-None widgets parameter from the startup script, otherwise it will block
        Clarisse's loading until the Qt window is closed.
        If you want to create a Qt application and run it through a Clarisse startup script, you need to use the
        non-blocking version of this method (e.g. call with widget as None) You can see the QtBasicStartup.py
        example script to see how it can be done.

    @param widgets
        This can be None, a single widget or a list of widgets. If not None, the call will not return unless all
        the widgets are closed. If you omit this parameter, the call returns immediately, and it's your responsability
        to make sure your UI stays alive.
